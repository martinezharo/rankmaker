                Well, there is no "us" here, really—just me. My name is <a

                </a>, and I'm the only person behind RANKMAKER. I'm just a guy
                from Spain with big ambitions who loves trying new things.
                RANKMAKER is one of those things I decided to dive into.
            </p>

            <p>
                One day, after a run, while getting ready to shower, a random
                memory popped into my head. A couple of years ago, I made a
                ranking of Formula 1 drivers that someone had shared on Twitter.
                There was something fascinating about it: I didn't have to think
                too hard about the exact order of the drivers, nor was it a tier
                list. I was just given different matchups, and in the end, I got
                a ranking based on my choices.
            </p>

            <p>
                At the time, I didn't think much of it, but for some reason, at
                that very moment, it came back to me. While in the shower, I
                kept thinking about it. I had no idea how to code, but I'm
                obsessed with AI.
            </p>

            <p>
                As soon as I got out of the shower, I played around with ChatGPT
                for a bit, and within minutes, I had a basic system where I
                could enter different options, compare them in matchups, and get
                a sorted ranking. I also realized that no website was doing
                exactly this. That was my chance.
            </p>

            <p>
                I thought I could finish the project with just a few more AI
                interactions… and I would've been right if by "a few" I meant
                literally thousands of iterations across different models. I had
                to learn some basic programming along the way because,
                apparently, you can't just copy-paste a couple of
                ChatGPT-generated codes into Notepad and call it a day.
            </p>

            <p>
                Honestly, I probably could've finished much faster by hiring
                someone on Fiverr, and the result would've been better. But
                that's just how I am.

                Why RANKMAKER?
            </h2>

            <p>
                The biggest inspiration for this project was <strong
                    class="text-text-primary">TIERMAKER</strong
                >, along with that F1 ranking site I mentioned earlier—though I
                never saw it again (probably just someone's side project).
            </p>

            <p>
                I've always loved ranking things (maybe that's some kind of
                disorder), but sometimes TIERMAKER felt overwhelming with so
                many choices at once, and the results didn't always reflect what
                I truly thought.
            </p>

            <p class="text-xl font-medium text-primary pt-2">
                So I fixed that with RANKMAKER.
